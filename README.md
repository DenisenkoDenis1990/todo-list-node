*_Develop ToDo application with authorization using JWT tokens_*

The application should restrict all unauthorized requests except registration and authorization. Password should be contained in the database in encrypted form.

An authorized user can create one or more ToDo lists. He also could be able to update, delete and get all ToDo lists he created.

For each ToDo list, he should be able to create, update, delete and get all the ToDo's he created.

*Backend*
_Framework_ - you could use anyone you like
_Database_ - you could use anyone you like
_ORM_ - you could use anyone you like

*Frontend* - Optional
You could use any FE framework, but probably your ToDo list Google wish to buy!

*CI/CD* - Optional
You could use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

*Hosting* - Optional
You can use [DOKKU|https://dokku.com/] instead of Heroku (since it's not free anymore). But again, it's optional.

Do not overdo this project! Keep in mind, its only purpose is to be a place to shape your skills, extend your knowledge, learn to write clear code and be sold to Google.

Have fun!
